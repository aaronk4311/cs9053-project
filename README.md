# cs9053-project
Final project for CS-9053 Introduction to Java. It is a game that recreates a subset of features seen in Metroid NES. The goal of this project was to demonstrate three *advanced* Java concepts/technologies that I learned during the 2nd half of the semester. I chose the following:
* libGDX as the framework for implementing the game. 
* JDBC to connect to a database which stores user statistics.
* Multithreading to process multiple NPCs at once.
